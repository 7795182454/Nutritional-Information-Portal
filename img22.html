    <ul><h1>Cancers linked to alcohol use</h1>

        <h2>Alcohol use has been linked with cancers of the:</h2><br/>

        <li>Mouth</li><br/>
        <li>Throat (pharynx)</li><br/>
        
        <li>Esophagus</li><br/>
        <li>Liver</li><br/></ul>
        
    <ul><h2>Mouth Cancer</h2>
        
        <li>Mouth cancer, or oral cancer, can occur anywhere in the mouth, on the surface of the tongue, the lips, inside the cheek, in the gums, in the roof and floor of the mouth, in the tonsils, and in the salivary glands.</li><br/>
        <li>It is a type of head and neck cancer and is often treated similarly to other head and neck cancers.</li><br/>



        <li>Mouth cancer mostly happens after the age of 40, and the risk is more than twice as high in men as it is in women.</li><br/></ul>
<ul>
    <h2>Signs and symptoms include:</h2>

<li>patches on the lining of the mouth or tongue, usually red or red and white in color
    mouth ulcers or sores that do not heal</li><br/>
    <li>swelling that persists for over 3 weeks</li><br/>
    <li>A lump or thickening of the skin or lining of the mouth</li><br/>
    <li>Pain when swallowing</li><br/>
    <li>Loose teeth with no apparent reason</li><br/>
    <li>poorly fitting dentures</li><br/>
    <li>jaw pain or stiffness</li><br/>
<li>sore throat<li/><br/>
    <li>a sensation that something is stuck in the throat</li><br/></ul>
    <ul><h1>Throat Cancer</h1>
        <li>Throat cancer refers to cancerous tumors that develop in your throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx) or tonsils.

Your throat is a muscular tube that begins behind your nose and ends in your neck. Throat cancer most often begins in the flat cells that line the inside of your throat.

Your voice box sits just below your throat and also is susceptible to throat cancer. The voice box is made of cartilage and contains the vocal cords that vibrate to make sound when you talk.

Throat cancer can also affect the piece of cartilage (epiglottis) that acts as a lid for your windpipe. Tonsil cancer, another form of throat cancer, affects the tonsils, which are located on the back of the throat.</li><br/></ul>
    <ul><h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <li>

            Signs and symptoms of throat cancer may include:</li><br/>

        <li>A cough</li><br/>
        <li>Changes in your voice, such as hoarseness or not speaking clearly</li><br/>
        <li>Difficulty swallowing</li><br/>
        <li>Ear pain</li><br/>
        <li>A lump or sore that doesn't heal</li><br/>
        <li>A sore throat</li><br/>
<li>Weight loss</li><br/>
    </ul>
<ul><h1>Esophagus Cancer</h1><br/>
    <li>Esophageal cancer is cancer that occurs in the esophagus — a long, hollow tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. Your esophagus helps move the food you swallow from the back of your throat to your stomach to be digested.

Esophageal cancer usually begins in the cells that line the inside of the esophagus. Esophageal cancer can occur anywhere along the esophagus. More men than women get esophageal cancer.

Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Incidence rates vary within different geographic locations. In some regions, higher rates of esophageal cancer cases may be attributed to tobacco and alcohol use or particular nutritional habits and obesity.</li>

    <h2>Symbols</h2><br/>
    
        <h3>Signs and symptoms of esophageal cancer include:</h3><br/>

        <li>Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)</li><br/>
        <li>Weight loss without trying</li><br/>
        <li>Chest pain, pressure or burning</li><br/>
        <li>Worsening indigestion or heartburn</li><br/>
        <li>Coughing or hoarseness</li><br/>

    
    
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <h2>Liver cancer</h2><br/>
    <li>Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver. Your liver is a football-sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath your diaphragm and above your stomach.

Several types of cancer can form in the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common.

        Not all cancers that affect the liver are considered liver cancer. Cancer that begins in another area of the body — such as the colon, lung or breast — and then spreads to the liver is called metastatic cancer rather than liver cancer. And this type of cancer is named after the organ in which it began — such as metastatic colon cancer to describe cancer that begins in the colon and spreads to the liver. Cancer that spreads to the liver is more common than cancer that begins in the liver cells.</li></ul>
    <ul>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <h3>Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include:</h3>

        <li>Losing weight without trying</li><br/>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li><br/>
        <li>Upper abdominal pain</li><br/>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li><br/>
        <li>General weakness and fatigue</li><br/>
        <li>Abdominal swelling</li><br/>
        <li>Yellow discoloration of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)</li><br/>
<li>White, chalky stools</li><br/>
