    <h1>How does smoking cause cancer?</h1>

        <li>Smoking is the biggest preventable cause of cancer in the UK</li><br/>
        <li>Chemicals in cigarette smoke enter our blood stream and can then affect the entire body, this is why smoking causes so many different types of cancer</li><br/>
<li>Stopping smoking completely is the best thing you can do for your health, and there are many ways you can do it
    Our bodies are designed to deal with a bit of damage, but they often can’t cope with the amount of harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke.</li><br/></ul>
<ul>
    <h2>What types of cancer does smoking cause?</h2>
<li>The link between smoking and cancer is very clear. It causes at least 15 different types of cancer.

    Smoking causes around 7 in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK, which is also the most common cause of cancer death.</li><br/>

    <li>It causes other cancers including mouth, pharynx (upper throat), nose and sinuses, larynx (voice box), oesophagus (food pipe), liver, pancreas, stomach, kidney, bowel, ovary, bladder, cervix, and some types of leukaemia.</li><br/>

    <li>Smoking causes other diseases too, such as heart disease and various lung diseases.</li><br/></ul>
<ul>
    <h2>
        What’s my cancer risk from smoking?</h2>
    <li>The number of years you spend smoking affects your cancer risk most strongly. For example, smoking one pack a day for 40 years is even more dangerous than smoking two packs a day for 20 years.

        So, it’s never too late to stop. Speak to your GP or pharmacist, or visit NHS Smokefree for free support to help you stop for good.</li><br/>

    <li>The more cigarettes you smoke a day, the higher your risk of cancer, so reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke a day can be a good first step.</li><br/>

    <li>Research has shown that for every 15 cigarettes smoked, there is a DNA change which could cause a cell in the body to become cancerous. But the best way to reduce your risk is to stop smoking completely.</li><br/></ul>
