   <p> In addition to chemicals and radiation, another source of mutation is viruses. Viruses are very small 'organisms' that can infect the cells of other animals or plants. Humans are susceptible to a large number of different viruses. Viruses are not the same as bacteria although both can cause human disease. Treatments that cure bacterial infections are not useful in the treatment of viral infection. Some examples of viruses include the agent that causes the flu (influenza virus) and the causative agent of AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Viruses can disrupt cell behavior in several different ways.

They can directly cause DNA damage (mutations) by inserting their genomes into the DNA of the host cell. The integration can disrupt important regulatory genes.
The viruses may contain their own genes that disrupt the regulation of the cell. This process may be beneficial to the virus if it allows for rapid production of progeny but can be seriously detrimental to the host.
Some viruses actually carry altered versions of genes that they have picked up from previous host cells. These altered genes no longer function properly, and when they are inserted into a new host cell, they cause disregulation and can lead to cancerous growth.
Through their mutagenic activity or their effects on cell behavior, viruses play a significant role in the development of particular cancers in many different animals, including humans.

Viruses have also been a major target of scientific investigation with respect to cancer. Some of the earliest work on the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressors utilized viruses.1

       Viruses can be divided into two rough categories, those that have DNA as their genetic material and those that have RNA as their genetic material. Both kinds of virus have been found to be associated with cancers of different types. Further information on the topics on this page can also be found in most introductory Biology textbooks, we recommend Campbell Biology, 11th edition.2 The viruses known to cause human cancers are:</p>

    <h2>Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) - Liver Cancer</h2><br/>
<li>Associated Cancer: Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Prevalence: HBV is prevalent on every continent, but is especially high in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. It is estimated that over 400 million people worldwide are infected.
Transmission: HBV is transmitted via contact with contaminated blood, sweat, or tears. It can also be spread through sexual contact and from mother to child.
Infection: HBV Infection occurs mainly in the liver, but viral antigens can be detected in the blood throughout the body. Chronic Infection is indicated by the presence of viral antigens in the blood for longer than 6 months. Chronic Infection can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and development of HCC.
    Carcinogenic Potential: Hepatitis viruses (B and C) are responsible for 70-85% of primary liver cancers. Viral integration into the host genome is regularly found in chronic liver infection and cancer. This suggests it plays an important role in carcinogenesis. HBV encodes a protein (HBX) that may promote cell proliferation and interfere with DNA repair. HBV mediated carcinogenesis is likely due to a number of factors; the oncogenic properties of HBX, chronic liver damage, chronic inflammation, and the continuous tissue regeneration needed to maintain the liver during an infection.</li><br/></ul>
<ul>
    <h2>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) - Liver Cancer36</h2><br/>
<li>Associated Cancer: Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Prevalence: HCV is prevalent on every continent, but it is especially high in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. It's estimated over 170 million people are infected with HCV worldwide.
Transmission: HCV is transmitted primarily through blood-blood contact.
Infection: HCV Infection occurs mainly in the liver and produces a more severe inflammation than HBV. Over 80% of those infected with HCV will develop cirrhosis of the liver or HCC.
    Carcinogenic Potential: Hepatitis B and C are responsible for 70-85% of primary liver cancers. HCV is not known to integrate into the host genome. In vitro HCV has been shown to affect a wide range of cellular mechanisms that may promote carcinogenesis, but these have not been reproduced in vivo. The carcinogenic potential of HCV lies in its ability to cause chronic immune response-mediated hepatic damage, inflammation, and tissue regeneration.</li></ul>
<ul>
    <h2>Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) - Kaposi's Sarcoma</h2><br/>
<li>Human Herpesvirus 8, aka Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV) 37

Associated Cancer: HHV8 primarily causes Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a type of cancer that affects the skin and soft organs. HHV8 is also associated with several blood disorders.
Prevalence: HHV8 is uncommon in most of the world, only 1-5% of people in North America and Northern Europe are infected. Mediterranean populations have a higher infection rate (5-20%) and Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate (>60%). In the U.S., gay men also have a higher infection rate (~40%).
Transmission: HHV8 is most commonly spread through sexual contact and via saliva. Transmission also may occur via organ transplantation or blood transfusion.
Infection: HHV8 infects B cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells and possibly monocytes. HHV8 infection is high in populations with high incidence of KS and low in populations with low incidence of KS.
    Carcinogenic Potential: HHV8 DNA is found in all cases of KS, but infection is not enough to cause cancer. The exact method by which HH8V induces cancer is still under investigation. KS probably starts as an inflammatory process to which circulating cells (including HHV8 infected cells) are recruited, leading to further inflammation, tissue damage, and viral infection. HHV8 then establishes a persistent infection which may send signals promoting angiogenesis and inflammation. This cycle may ultimately lead to tumor development. Untreated AIDS confers a 20,000 fold higher risk of developing KS, but other than immunosuppression the role of AIDS is generally unknown.</li></ul>

        <li>HPV and Cervical Cancer

            The human papillomavirus is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer. It is responsible for at least 90% of cases. High risk HPV type 16 is the most common high-risk type and is found in over 50% of cervical cancers. The second most common high-risk type is 18 and it is responsible for 10-12% of cervical cancers. Although HPV responsible for virtually all cases of cervical cancer, 80% of women clear an infection within 1-2 years.</li></ul>
