    <h1>Ways to Prevent Diabetes</h1>

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Uncontrolled cases can cause blindness, kidney failure, heart disease and other serious conditions.

Before diabetes is diagnosed, there is a period where blood sugar levels are high but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. This is known as prediabetes.

It's estimated that up to 70% of people with prediabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, progressing from prediabetes to diabetes isn't inevitable (1).

Although there are certain factors you can't change — such as your genes, age or past behaviors — there are many actions you can take to reduce the risk of diabetes.

Here are ways to avoid getting diabetes.
<ul>
    <li>Cut Sugar and Refined Carbs From Your Diet</li>
    <li>Eating sugary foods and refined carbs can put at-risk individuals on the fast track to developing diabetes</li>

    <li>Your body rapidly breaks these foods down into small sugar molecules, which are absorbed into your bloodstream.</li>

    <li>The resulting rise in blood sugar stimulates your pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone that helps sugar get out of the bloodstream and into your body's cells.</li>

    <li>In people with prediabetes, the body's cells are resistant to insulin's action, so sugar remains high in the blood. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin, attempting to bring blood sugar down to a healthy level.</li>

    <li>Over time, this can lead to progressively higher blood sugar and insulin levels, until the condition eventually turns into type 2 diabetes.</li>

    </ul>
<ul> Work Out Regularly
    
    <li>Performing physical activity on a regular basis may help prevent diabetes.</li>

    <li>Exercise increases the insulin sensitivity of your cells. So when you exercise, less insulin is required to keep your blood sugar levels under control.</li>

    <li>One study in people with prediabetes found that moderate-intensity exercise increased insulin sensitivity by 51% and high-intensity exercise increased it by 85%. However, this effect only occurred on workout days ().</li>

    <li>Many types of physical activity have been shown to reduce insulin resistance and blood sugar in overweight, obese and prediabetic adults. These include aerobic exercise, high-intensity interval training and strength training .</li>

    <li>Working out more frequently seems to lead to improvements in insulin response and function. One study in people at risk of diabetes found that burning more than 2,000 calories weekly via exercise was required to achieve these benefits ().</li>

    </ul>

<ul>Drink Water as Your Primary Beverage
    <li>Water is by far the most natural beverage you can drink.</li>

    <li>What's more, sticking with water most of the time helps you avoid beverages that are high in sugar, preservatives and other questionable ingredients.</li>

    <li>Sugary beverages like soda and punch have been linked to an increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA).</li>

    <li>LADA is a form of type 1 diabetes that occurs in people over 18 years of age. Unlike the acute symptoms seen with type 1 diabetes in childhood, LADA develops slowly, requiring more treatment as the disease progresses ().</li>

    <li>One large observational study looked at the diabetes risk of 2,800 people.</li>

    <li>Those who consumed more than two servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per day had a 99% increased risk of developing LADA and a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes ().</li>

    <li>Researchers of one study on the effects of sweet drinks on diabetes stated that neither artificially sweetened beverages nor fruit juice were good beverages for diabetes prevention ().</li>

    <li>By contrast, consuming water may provide benefits. Some studies have found that increased water consumption may lead to better blood sugar control and insulin response (, ).</li></ul>


<ul>Lose Weight If You're Overweight or Obese
    <li>Although not everyone who develops type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese, the majority are.</li>

    <li>What's more, those with prediabetes tend to carry excess weight in their midsection and around abdominal organs like the liver. This is known as visceral fat.</li>

    <li>Excess visceral fat promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, which significantly increase the risk of diabetes.</li>

    <li>Although losing even a small amount of weight can help reduce this risk, studies show that the more you lose, the more benefits you'll experience (, ).</li>

    <li>One study of more than 1,000 people with prediabetes found that for every kilogram (2.2 lbs) of weight participants lost, their risk of diabetes reduced by 16%, up to a maximum reduction of 96% ().</li>

    <li>There are many healthy options for losing weight, including low-carb, Mediterranean, paleo and vegetarian diets. However, choosing a way of eating you can stick with long-term is key to helping you maintain the weight loss.</li>

    </ul>
<ul> Quit Smoking
    <li>Smoking has been shown to cause or contribute to many serious health conditions, including heart disease, emphysema and cancers of the lung, breast, prostate and digestive tract ().</li>

    <li>There's also research linking smoking and second-hand smoke exposure to type 2 diabetes </li>

    <li>In an analysis of several studies totaling over one million people, smoking was found to increase the risk of diabetes by 44% in average smokers and 61% in people who smoked more than 20 cigarettes daily ().</li>

    <li>One study followed the risk of diabetes in middle-aged male smokers after they quit. After five years their risk had reduced by 13%, and after 20 years they had the same risk as people who had never smoked ().</li>

    <li>Researchers stated that even though many of the men gained weight after quitting, after several smoke-free years, their risk of diabetes was lower than if they'd continued smoking.</li></ul>


<ul> Follow a Very-Low-Carb Diet

    <li>Although there are a number of ways of eating that promote weight loss, very-low-carb diets have strong evidence behind them.</li>

    <li>They have consistently been shown to lower blood sugar and insulin levels, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce other diabetes risk factors .</li>

    <li>In a 12-week study, prediabetic individuals consumed either a low-fat or low-carb diet. Blood sugar dropped by 12% and insulin dropped by 50% in the low-carb group.</li>

    <li>In the low-fat group, meanwhile, blood sugar dropped by only 1% and insulin dropped by 19%. Thus, the low-carb diet had better results on both counts ().</li>

    <li>If you minimize your carb intake, your blood sugar levels won't rise very much after you eat. Therefore, your body needs less insulin to maintain your blood sugar within healthy levels.</li></ul>


<ul>Watch Portion Sizes
    <li>Whether or not you decide to follow a low-carb diet, it's important to avoid large portions of food to reduce the risk of diabetes, especially if you are overweight.</li>

<li>Eating too much food at one time has been shown to cause higher blood sugar and insulin levels in people at risk of diabetes ().

    On the other hand, decreasing portion sizes may help prevent this type of response.</li>

    <li>A two-year study in prediabetic men found that those who reduced food portion sizes and practiced other healthful nutrition behaviors had a 46% lower risk of developing diabetes than the men who made no lifestyle changes ().</li>

    <li>Another study looking at weight loss methods in people with prediabetes reported that the group practicing portion control lowered their blood sugar and insulin levels significantly after 12 weeks ().</li></ul>



 <ul>Minimize Your Intake of Processed Foods
     <li>One clear step you can take to improve your health is to minimize your consumption of processed foods.</li>

     <li>They're linked to all sorts of health problems, including heart disease, obesity and diabetes.</li>

     <li>Studies suggest that cutting back on packaged foods that are high in vegetable oils, refined grains and additives may help reduce the risk of diabetes.</li>

     <li>This may be partly due to the protective effects of whole foods like nuts, vegetables, fruits and other plant foods.</li>

     <li>One study found that poor-quality diets that were high in processed foods increased the risk of diabetes by 30%. However, including nutritious whole foods helped reduce this risk ().</li></ul>
