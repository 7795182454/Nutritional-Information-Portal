<h1>CAUSES OF DIABITIES</h1>   
<p class="m">
    
There is no one common diabetes cause
Diabetes causes vary depending on your genetic makeup, family history, ethnicity, health and environmental factors.

There is no common diabetes cause that fits every type of diabetes.

The reason there is no defined diabetes cause is because the causes of diabetes vary depending on the individual and the type.

For instance; the causes of type 1 diabetes vary considerably from the causes of gestational diabetes.

Similarly, the causes of type 2 diabetes are distinct from the causes of type 1 diabetes.
    increased thirst and urination
increased hunger
fatigue
blurred vision
numbness or tingling in the feet or hands
sores that do not heal
unexplained weight loss
    Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly—over the course of several years—and can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. Some people do not find out they have the disease until they have diabetes-related health problems, such as blurred vision or heart trouble<br/>Type 1 diabetes causes<br/>

Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system destroying the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. This causes diabetes by leaving the body without enough insulin to function normally.


This is called an autoimmune reaction, or autoimmune cause, because the body is attacking itself.

There is no specific diabetes causes, but the following triggers may be involved:

Viral or bacterial infection
Chemical toxins within food
Unidentified component causing autoimmune reaction
Underlying genetic disposition may also be a type 1 diabetes cause.

Type 2 diabetes causes

Type 2 diabetes causes are usually multifactorial - more than one diabetes cause is involved. Often, the most overwhelming factor is a family history of type 2 diabetes.

This is the most likely type 2 diabetes cause.

There are a variety of risk factors for type 2 diabetes, any or all of which increase the chances of developing the condition.

These include: 

Obesity
Living a sedentary lifestyle
Increasing age
Bad diet
    Other type 2 diabetes causes such as pregnancy or illness can be type 2 diabetes risk factors.
